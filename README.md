# Form validation

This challenge will evaluate how you approach solving a real-world problem. We recommend you spend around **2 hours** working on it as we don't want you to burn through your whole day!

## The problem

Included in this repository is an [index.html](index.html) file that contains a form. Your task is to convert this form into a React application. You must ensure all of the following rules are met before the form is posted to an imaginary server:

* `Email` must be a valid email address.
* `Password` must be longer than 8 characters.
* `Colour` must be selected.
* At least two `Animals` must be chosen.
* If `Tiger` is one of the chosen `Animal`s then `Type of tiger` is required to be a non-empty string.

## Other requirements

If the form is submitted and an error occurs, the error element's parent should have a CSS `error` class added to it.

```html
<p class="error">
    <label for="field"></label>
    <input id="field" type="text" value="foo">
</p>
```
